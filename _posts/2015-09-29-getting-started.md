The voOot documentation is organised into the following sections:

  * Articles
  * Developer Guides
  * API References
  * Extras

Articles will contain best practices and how-to's for working with voOot developer libraries and the SnowShoe website.

Developer Guides will contain tutorials for implementing and using the voOot API and its libraries.

API References will explain endpoint behaviour and any upgrades to the API.

Extras will contain more great information provided by community developers like you.

We love easy-to-implement, well documented API's. Our aim is to provided you concise, relevant documentation to get you and your team up and stamping with voOot with as little effort as possible.

We would love to hear from you. Please send any comments, suggestions or The Hague food recommendations to support@vooot.nl.
